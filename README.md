# Browser-Automation

The complete code for the project is present in BrowserAutomation.py which is an app made to automate some basic mundane tasks in chrome browser using Selenium framework and Google's Speech to Text API to provide a virtual assistant vibe.

You need to use the browser driver according to the browser you use, In my case I used chromedriver v81.0. 

You also need to install some basic libraries like selenium, speechrecognition and install pyaudio through whl file in order to run the code.
